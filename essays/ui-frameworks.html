<h2 id="reaching-the-front">Reaching the front</h2>
<p>As a guy with no previous experience with frontend development, I had a hard time when one of my college classes started requiring me to build webpages in HTML and CSS. The progress was slow, I had to look up everything, and the layout never turned out exactly as I thought it would. My webpages looked old school, and creating a modern layout took ages. I was really looking forward to learning a framework for my HTML, hoping it would make frontend development easier. We started using Bootstrap 5.</p>

<h2 id="missing-in-action-ui">Missing in action: UI</h2>
<p>And it did not make my coding easier - at first. I was hoping for a rich graphic user interface where I could drag and drop elements, and having the HTML written automatically. But no. Bootstrap is a framework for HTML and CSS, not a tool for building webpages. I had just gotten familiar with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;p&gt;</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;img&gt;</code>, and now I suddenly had to learn a lot more <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">class="container"</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">class="row"</code>. This was like learning a new language again? I did see how my this is a tool for professionals, but what about me? While using Bootstrap the first times, I spent way more time in the documentation than I did actually coding. I guess this is quite common when learning a new framework, but it feels slow and not very productive. I could’ve created the webpage faster using raw HTML, and not scrolling back and forth in the documentation for hours.</p>

<h2 id="getting-familiar">Getting familiar</h2>
<p>But, as my instructor always says, it’s through using new framework you actually get better. After completing a few assignments using Bootstrap, the whole grid-system, and ease with creating navbars, suddenly made me able to recreate website quite fast. And position elements just where I wanted. I guess a framework actually makes frontend development easier. And it’s worth learning, even though it may seem a bit overwhelming in the beginning. Get through the first few tutorials, learn how to navigate the documentation, and suddenly you’ll find yourself creating webpages in no time. With a layout you’re proud of.</p>
