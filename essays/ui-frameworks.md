## Reaching the front
As a guy with no previous experience with frontend development, I had a hard time when one of my college classes started requiring me to build webpages in HTML and CSS. The progress was slow, I had to look up everything, and the layout never turned out exactly as I thought it would. My webpages looked old school, and creating a modern layout took ages. I was really looking forward to learning a framework for my HTML, hoping it would make frontend development easier. We started using Bootstrap 5. 

## Missing in action: UI
And it did not make my coding easier - at first. I was hoping for a rich graphic user interface where I could drag and drop elements, and having the HTML written automatically. But no. Bootstrap is a framework for HTML and CSS, not a tool for building webpages. I had just gotten familiar with ```<p>``` and ```<img>```, and now I suddenly had to learn a lot more ```class="container"``` and ```class="row"```. This was like learning a new language again? I did see how my this is a tool for professionals, but what about me? While using Bootstrap the first times, I spent way more time in the documentation than I did actually coding. I guess this is quite common when learning a new framework, but it feels slow and not very productive. I could've created the webpage faster using raw HTML, and not scrolling back and forth in the documentation for hours.

## Getting familiar
But, as my instructor always says, it's through using new framework you actually get better. After completing a few assignments using Bootstrap, the whole grid-system, and ease with creating navbars, suddenly made me able to recreate website quite fast. And position elements just where I wanted. I guess a framework actually makes frontend development easier. And it's worth learning, even though it may seem a bit overwhelming in the beginning. Get through the first few tutorials, learn how to navigate the documentation, and suddenly you'll find yourself creating webpages in no time. With a layout you're proud of.
