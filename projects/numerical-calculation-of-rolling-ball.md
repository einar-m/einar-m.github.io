This report was created in a physics class (TFY4107) at Norwegian University of Science and Technology. The report was created by Albert Str√∏mhylden, Amund Wirstad, Magnus Trandokken and myself. The report calcutaed a rolling ball's velicoty and energy, and compared this to real measurements. We used Nympy to do calculatons and plot the results

My main area of responsibility was to write the calculations, LaTeX-functions and plot in the Results chapter. This was the first time I used Python for a big numerical project, and it gave me more experience and confindence in Python's mathematical abilities. The extensive use of plotting made me more comfortable in using Numpy, and exploring all the visualization opportunities it gives.
